# Front-end-techdegree-unit1
1st unit of the Front-end techdegree

What an experience!

If I knew coding would have been this rewarding,
then I would have done it a lot sooner.

Love learning new things, 
Love learning by applying them, 
Love learning through trial and error

This is the 1st of many projects I will be doing for the
Treehouse Front-end TechDegree

In short, this is my personal profile page.
And as you can see, I've had a lot of fun.
